> Hereâ€™s Moore and Haran: Our studies consistently show that forecasts made using SPIES hit the correct answer more frequently than other forecasting methods. For example, in one study, participants used both [traditional] confidence intervals and SPIES to estimate temperatures. While their 90% confidence intervals included the correct answer about 30% of the time, the hit-rate of intervals produced by the SPIES method was just shy of 74%. Another study included a quiz of the dates in which various historical events occurred. Participants who used [traditional] 90% confidence intervals answered 54% of the questions correctly. The confidence intervals SPIES produced, however, resulted in accurate estimates 77% of the time."
